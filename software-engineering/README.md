# New requirements

~~This git repository uses [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/)~~

GitHub does not support LFS in public forks, file added without git lfs.

# TODO:
* replace deprecate package in frontend - `[DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The 'punycode' module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.`
* write frontend test, fix broken fe test
* extend backend test, currently there is one backend test to show an example
* write better frontend, currently is as minimal as possible
* attach Pycharm test configuration (like [backend django configuration](../.idea/runConfigurations/backend.xml))
* write documentation about pre-commit content (fe and be formatters)
